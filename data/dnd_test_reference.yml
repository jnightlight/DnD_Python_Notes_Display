    - Two-Weapon Fighting: >
        When you take the <bold> <italic> Attack action </bold> </italic> and attack with a light melee weapon that 
        you're holding in one hand, you can use a <bold> <italic> bonus action </bold> </italic> to attack with a
        <bold> <italic> different light melee weapon </bold> </italic> that you're holding in the other hand. You <bold> <blink> don't
        add your ability modifier to the damage </bold> </blink> of the bonus attack, unless that
        modifier is negative.
- CLASS_SORCERER:
    - Wild Magic Surge: >
        Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting 
        can unleash surges of untamed magic. <bold> Once per turn, </bold> the DM can have 
        you roll a d20 <bold> immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level 
        or higher. </bold> If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create 
        a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be 
        affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it 
        doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
    - Tides of Chaos: >
        Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos
        to <bold> <italic> gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or
        saving throw. </bold> </italic> Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you
        can use this feature again.
        <bold> Any time </bold> before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge 
        table <bold> <italic> immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher.  </bold> </italic> You 
        then regain the use of this feature.
    - Metamagic:
        - Metamagic_Rules: >
            At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. 
            You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. 
            You gain another one at <bold> 10th and 17th level. </bold>
            <blink> <bold> You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,
            unless otherwise noted. </blink> </bold>
        - Subtle Spell: >
            When you cast a spell, you can spend <bold> 1 sorcery point </bold> to cast 
            it <italic> without any somatic or verbal components. </italic>
        - Twinned Spell: >
            <bold> When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a 
            range of self, </bold> you can spend a number of <bold> sorcery points equal to the 
            spell's level </bold> to target a second creature in range with the same spell 
            (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). To be eligible, a spell 
            <bold> must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's 
            current level. </bold> For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't 
            eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.
- FEATS:
    - Actor: >
        Skilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:

        - Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

        - You have an advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass 
        yourself off as a different person.

        - You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have 
        heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful 
        Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that 
        the effect is faked.

            You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one 
            creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an 
            Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract

            You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a 
            melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of 
            you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal 
            effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to 
            a different creature of your choice that you can see within 
            5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your 
            spellcasting ability modifier.

            You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a
            message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can 
            reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
            
            You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with 
            the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 
            foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 
            feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a 
            straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

            This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use 
            for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range-
            You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a 
            shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical
            notes, or an odd odor.
            You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a 
            torch, or a small campfire.
            You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger 
            than 1 cubic foot.
            You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving 
            material for 1 hour.
            You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an 
            object or a surface for 1 hour.
            You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that 
            can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end 
            of your next turn.
            If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
    - 1ST LEVEL:

            <bold> Duration: </bold> 8 hours </italic>
            
            You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective
            magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC 
            becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target 
            dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

        - Silvery Barbs: >
            <bold> <italic> Casting Time: </bold> 1 reaction, which you take when a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw

            <bold> Duration: </bold> Instantaneous </italic>
            
            You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary 
            uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature 
            must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll.
            
            You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you 
            can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack 
            roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can 
            be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.

            <bold> <italic> Casting Time: </bold> 1 action
            
            <bold> Range: </bold> 30 feet
            
            <bold> Target: </bold> A creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you
            
            <bold> Components: </bold> V M (A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
            
            <bold> Duration: </bold> Up to 8 hours </italic>
            
            You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and 
            magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear 
            and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this 
            effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the 
            course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw 
            itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful 
            act ends the spell.
            
            The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the 
            course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course 
            of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can 
            be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes 
            what it was asked to do.
            
            You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during 
            the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse 
            to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell 
            expires, the activity isn't performed.
            
            If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.
        - Phantasmal Force: >
            <bold> <italic> Casting Time: </bold> 1 action
            
            <bold> Range: </bold> 60 feet
            
            <bold> Components: </bold> V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
            
            <bold> Duration: </bold> Concentration, up to 1 minute </italic>
            
            You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you 
            can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. 
            On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible 
            phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that 
            is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect 
            on undead or constructs.
            
            The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only 
            to the creature.
            
            The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence 
            (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the 
            target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
            
            While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the 
            phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes 
            from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to 
            walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps 
            onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that 
            the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall; 
            it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
            
            An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it 
            can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as 
            a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear 
            as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your 
            turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in 
            the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the 
            illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, 
            such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type 
            appropriate to the illusion.
        - Enlarge/Reduce: >
            <bold> <italic> Casting Time: </bold> 1 action
            
            <bold> Range: </bold> 30 feet
            
            <bold> Components: </bold> V, S, M (A pinch of iron powder)
            
            <bold> Duration: </bold> Concentration, up to 1 minute </italic>
            
            You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. 
            Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can 
            make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
            
            If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item 
            dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.
            
            Enlarge. The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth 
            increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the 
            target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. 
            Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The 
            target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attack 
            with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
            
            Reduce. The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. 
            This reduction decreases its size by one category - from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell 
            ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's 
            weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with 
            them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

- RULES:
    - Spell Scrolls: >
        A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your 
        class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. 
        Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal 
        casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is 
        interrupted, the scroll is not lost.
        
        If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make 
        an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC 
        equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
        
        The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well 
        as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.
        
        A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell 
        is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC 
        equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check 
        succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
